            <h2 class="header">Mixing Homemade Lemonade</h2>
            <div class="method">  <b> 1 </b>
                   <p> Juice 8 lemons to get about 1 cup (240 mL) of lemon juice. Roll your lemons on the countertop to make them easier to juice. Next, cut your lemons in half and press them onto a lemon press over a pitcher or measuring cup. Twist the lemon halves over the press to get as much juice out as possible.<br><br>[2]
                    Microwave your lemons for 10-20 seconds to soften the pulp and get more juice.<br><br>
                    If you don't have a lemon press, squeeze the lemon to get most of the juice out. <br>Then, press a fork or mixer beater into the lemon pulp and twist it to release the rest of the juice.<br>
                    You can get a lemon press at your local grocery or department store or online.<br><br></p>

                    <b> 2 </b>
                   <p> Transfer the lemon juice into a large pitcher. If you like pulp in your lemon juice, pour the squeezed lemon juice directly into the pitcher.<br> If you don’t like pulp, hold a strainer over the pitcher and pour the lemon juice over the strainer to catch the pulp. <br>Then, empty the strainer into your compost or trash.<br><br>[3]
                    Make sure your pitcher can hold at least 8 cups (1.9 L) of fluids.<br><br></p>

                   <p> <b> 3 </b>
                    Pour 1 cup (225 g) of sugar into the lemon juice and stir to dissolve it. Since lemon juice is acidic, it can dissolve your sugar for you, which saves you a lot of work! Add the sugar directly into your lemon juice, then stir until the sugar dissolves. This should take about 3-4 minutes.<br>[4]
                    If you don’t want your lemonade to be as sweet, you can add less sugar. Try adding just 1/2 or 3/4 cup (112-165 g) of sugar.<br>
                    Don’t add your water until the sugar dissolves so that the lemon juice isn’t diluted. It will take the sugar longer to dissolve in diluted lemon juice.<br><br>
                    Variation: You may prefer to use simple syrup instead of dissolving your sugar in the lemon juice because it's more traditional and may dissolve more of the sugar.<br> To make simple syrup, add 1 cup (240 mL) of your water to a saucepan, then add 1 cup (225 g) of sugar. Warm the sugar water over medium heat for about 4 minutes to dissolve the sugar. Then, let it cool to room temperature before adding it to your lemonade.<br><br>
                   </p>

                   <p> <b> 4 </b>
                    Add 6 cups (1.4 L) of cool water to your pitcher. Measure out your water using a large measuring cup. Then, slowly pour your water into the pitcher.<br>
                    It’s best to use cool water so that your lemonade will chill faster.<br>
                    If you made simple syrup, just add 5 cups (1.2 L) of water.<br></p>

                    <p><b> 5 </b>
                    Stir the lemonade with a large spoon to combine your ingredients. Use a large plastic or wooden spoon to mix your lemonade. Continue to stir until the color is uniform and you don't see more than a light dusting of sugar settled at the bottom of the pitcher.<br>
                    You may see some sugar at the bottom of the pitcher, and that’s okay. However, you shouldn't see a cloud of sugar.<br>
                    <b> 6 </b>
                    Taste your lemonade to make sure you like it. Use a spoon to scoop out a sip of lemonade. Then, taste the lemonade to see if it tastes good to you. If your lemonade doesn’t taste right, try adding one of the following:<br>
                    If the lemonade is too sour, add a few tablespoons of sugar.<br>
                    If the lemonade is too sweet, add the juice of half a lemon.<br></p>

                    <p><b> 7 </b>
                    Serve your lemonade over ice so it’s chilled. If you want to serve your lemonade immediately, it’ll taste best over ice. Place a couple of ice cubes in your glass, then pour your lemonade over it. Drink it immediately so the ice doesn’t melt and dilute your lemonade.<br>
                    After your lemonade is cold, it’s up to you if you want to use ice. If you don’t like ice, it’s okay to skip it.<br>
                    <b> 8 </b>
                    Store your lemonade in your refrigerator for up to 5 days. Cover your pitcher with a lid or a sheet of plastic wrap.<br> Then, put it into the refrigerator. It’ll keep for about 4-5 days.<br>
                    Stir your lemonade before you serve it so that the ingredients will be mixed well. It’s normal for them to separate while the lemonade sits in the refrigerator. <br><br>
                    Tip: If you’re waiting for your lemonade to chill, it’ll be cool in about 3 hours.<br></p>

            If you’re having a party or just want to feel fancy, garnishing your glass can make your lemonade look fancier. Choose a special glass, add sprigs of herbs, or use fruit slices. Here are some ideas: <br>
            Slip a short sprig of lavender, rosemary, or thyme into each glass.<br>
            Drop 2-3 fresh mint or basil leaves into the lemonade.<br>
            Cut a slit into lemon or lime slices, then slide 1 onto each glass.<br>
            Slice the bottom of a strawberry and push it down onto the rim of the glass.<br>
            Serve the lemonade in mason jars and add a colorful paper straw for a rustic touch.<br>
            Serve the lemonade in a tall glass with a paper umbrella and a maraschino cherry for a tropical refreshment.</blockquote>
